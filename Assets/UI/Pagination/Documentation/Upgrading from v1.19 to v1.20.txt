Upgrading from v1.19 to v1.20
--------------------------------------------------

This should generally be a seamless process, however some of the classes were moved around so please be aware that if you are using Nested ScrollRects, you will need to make the following adjustment:

Nested ScrollRects should have a 'PassThroughDragEvents' MonoBehaviour, however in some cases this behaviour may be missing after upgrading to v1.20.
You will need to add it back, and set up the following:

1. Targets: Add a single entry, and specify the PagedRect itself
2. Desired Target Types: Add two entries: Type in 'PagedRect', and 'PagedRect_ScrollRect'

That should be all that is necessary, and again, it should only be necessary if you are using nested ScrollRects.
