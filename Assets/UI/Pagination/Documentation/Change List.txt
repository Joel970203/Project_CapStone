v1.54
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Moved 'LimitDraggingToOnePageAtATime' to its own section in the inspector
  (titled 'Dragging'). It now affects regular PagedRects as well.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.53
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added the option to limit dragging to a single page at a time for
  Page Previews PagedRects
- Fixed an exception which ocurred when calling RemoveAllPages()
- Fixed some issues with Unity 2019
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.52
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed an issue where page positioning was sometimes off in Unity 2019
- Fixed an issue where error messages were displayed when creating a new
  prefab using PagedRect
- Fixed an issue where disabling and re-enabling dragging wouldn't work
  correctly
- Added some new 'Set' methods for properties
- 'AutomaticallyMoveToNextPage' will no longer trigger while a drag is
  in progress
- Added a new example scene
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.51
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Experimental: New 'Animation -> Animation Curve' option which allows you
  to specify an optional animation curve to use when animating to new pages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.50
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Some minor performance improvements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.49
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Adjusted the appearance of the default pagination for vertical PagedRects
  created via the menu so that they look more like the examples.
- Added the 'Performance' section to the inspector with options to:
  - Disable automatic page collection management (to reduce PagedRect's memory
    usage per frame)
- Fixed a minor issue where seamless looping was moving pages when there were
  3 pages while dragging, which unfortunately isn't seamless
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.48
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Made an adjustment to the code which determines which page to select
  when dragging (before now, it would always move to the closest page,
  now it will do so unless the closest page is already selected, in which
  case it will be more likely to move to the next closest page depending
  on how far away it is).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.47
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed some page positioning issues with Unity 2018
- PagedRect will no longer add 'Animator' components to pages when using a
  ScrollRect (this was leading to some odd issues in Unity 2018). The
  Animator component is only necessary for Legacy PagedRects.
- PagedRect_LayoutGroup now uses anchoredPosition rather than localPosition
- Fixed an issue where, after removing a page, the Page collection
  would sometimes still contain that page if Unity did not remove the
  Page GameObject immediately
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.46
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- RemoveAllPages() will no longer trigger a PageChangedEvent
- When adding a new page to an empty PagedRect, that page will now be set
  as the current page
- Drag and ScrollWheel events will no longer attempt to activate
  seamless looping functionality when the number of pages is lower than 3
  (as per regular seamless looping)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.45
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed an issue where 'SpaceBetweenPages' was not correctly being taken
  into account when sizing the viewport (making the PagedRect sometimes
  off-center on the final page)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.44
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you remove the current page, PagedRect will now automatically move to
  to the previous page, preventing a potential StackOverflow Exception
- Improved handling of the addition of new pages and removing of existing
  when using Seamless Looping
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.43
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed an issue where PagedRect would sometimes scroll endlessly even when
  "Loop Endlessly" was set to false
- Fixed a bug where sometimes buttons would not look correct in Unity 2017.3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.42
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Some internal adjustments have been made such that PagedRect now functions
  better when the TimeScale has been set to 0.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.41
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You can now set icons (and their colors) for each page. You can enable this
  behaviour by setting the new 'ShowPageIconsOnButtons' option.
- Added '(Legacy)' to the older PagedRect Prefab menu items and moved them
  to the bottom of the list.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.40
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Next and Previous buttons will now be marked as non-interactable
  when on the first / last pages (when Loop Endlessly is disabled), allowing
  you to use the 'Disabled Color' option to customize their appearance
  at that time (e.g. to hide them when disabled)
- When dragging left on the first page, or right on the last page in a
  ScrollRect based PagedRect, the 'Loop Endlessly' option will now be respected
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.39
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.38 which resulted in PagedRect objects no
  longer creating a canvas if one was not found in the scene
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.38
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Animation fields are now marked as "Legacy (Non-ScrollRect) Animation"
- "Mobile Input" is now marked as "Legacy (Non-ScrollRect) Input"
  (Please note: "Use Swipe Input" can still be used with "Page Previews")
- Added the "Use Swipe Input For ScrollRect" property which specifies whether
  or not Scrollrect-based PagedRects should accept swipe input
- Fixed a bug which could cause Pages to flash when seamless looping was enabled
  with a 5 or fewer pages in Page Previews mode.
- Fixed a potential null reference exception when using nested scrollrects.
- SetCurrentPage() will now clear any animations in progress when passed a
  value of 'true' as the second argument (Legacy PagedRects only)
- SetCurrentPage() will now reset the timer for automatically moving to the
  next page when it is called.
- Pagination buttons are now pooled, reducing the overhead involved in
  changing pages/etc.
  Please note: if you edit the button templates at runtime, you will need to
  call the new InvalidateButtonPool() method in order to replicate changes
  to the buttons.
- The Pagination section of each PagedRect is now isolated from the rest of
  the PagedRect and Canvas so that any layout rebuild events triggered within
  it are not propagated to the rest of the UI, resulting in a minor improvement
  to performance.
- The 'AutoDiscoverPages' property has been removed and is now always considered
  to be true.
- Fixed a bug preventing 'Show on Pagination' from working correctly when cleared
  Pages with this value cleared will now correctly be hidden from the pagination,
  and will not be eligible to be selected as a 'Next', 'Previous', 'First', or
  'Last' page when those buttons are used. It can still be selected by instructing
  the PagedRect to show that page with SetCurrentPage().
  If using a ScrollRect, the page can still be scrolled to, but will not show up
  on the pagination.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.37
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PagedRects will now highlight the currently visible page in the pagination
  when dragging long distances left or right
- PagedRects using Page Previews now support dragging. To enable this
  functionality:
  a) Ensure that PagedRect's 'Mobile Input -> Use Swipe Input' is disabled,
     as this will interfere with dragging left/right
  b) Clear the PagedRect_ScrollRect's 'Disable Dragging' property.
     (The PagedRect_ScrollRect component is on the same GameObject as the
	 PagedRect component)
  Please note that, for now, using inertia is unsupported, but this may be
  supported in future versions of PagedRect.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.36
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improved drag-handling, drags which take longer than 0.25 seconds will no
  longer be considered potential swipes (which move one page forward or
  backwards) and instead will now always use the default behaviour (which
  is to center on the closest page when the drag ended).
- Seamless looping will now work better than before when dragging through
  many pages at once.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.35
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed the positioning of the nested Scrollrect prefab's content transform
- The Z-scale of pages should now always be 1 instead of 0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.34
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PagedRects nested within another PagedRect will no longer sometimes have
  their page buttons removed by the parent.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.33
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The 'Loop Seamlessly' option will now be ignored in PagedRects with three
  or fewer pages (as it does not work correctly for them).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.32
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a new option to 'Page Previews' PagedRects which allows you to
  avoid PagedRect creating Page Overlays to highlight the previous/next
  pages on mouse over, as well as intercepting clicks (so that you can click
  to go to the next/previous page). In most scenarios, the overlays should be
  left enabled, but if, for example, you wish to add custom click functionality
  of your own, then disabling the overlays allows you to add your own onclick
  functionality to the underlying pages and have it be triggered when clicking
  on the preview pages.
- Reworked the 'MobileInput' component a little bit so that it handles
  different canvas render modes better.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.31
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- For non-scrollrect based PagedRects, swipes which are not within the confines
  of the PagedRect will no longer incorrectly cause te PagedRect to change
  pages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.30
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed some potential scrollbar issues and prevented a possible null exception
  when dealing with one or fewer pages (thanks to @PolarMotion for pointing
  these out!)
- Added a new Tabs Prefab Menu Item
- Added the new Tabs Prefab to the example scene
- Reworked the Example Scene controls a bit to use the available space
  a little better
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.29
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where pages would sometimes be moved incorrectly during
  seamless looping
- Fixed a bug where sometimes swiping would result in skipping a page
  when using nested scrollrects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.28
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where the Nested ScrollRect example was using the 'MobileInput'
  component (which is intended only for non-scrollrect based PagedRects [with
  the exception of the PagePreviews PagedRects])
- Modified the usage of the 'MobileInput' component so that non-ScrollRect
  based PagedRects will no longer accept vertical swipe input for PagedRects
  using horizontal slide animations, and PagedRects using vertical slide
  animations will no longer accept horizontal swipe input. PagedRects using
  Fade animations will still accept swipes in both directions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where Page Previews would ignore the "Use Swipe Input" setting
- Fixed a potential editor crash when using PagedRect with XmlLayout
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.26
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug in RemovePage() when working with ScrollRects
- Added a new RemovePage() overlay which accepts a page number
- Fixed a minor bug in RemovePage() which could cause pages to not be considered
  'removed' until the next frame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.25
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You can now move pages by using the page.SetPagePosition() method
  (You can access pages by using PagedRect.GetPageByNumber())
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.24
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PagedRects using ScrollRects now use a new LayoutGroup designed just for
  PagedRect which supports page scaling
- "Paged Previews" functionality now scales pages up and down rather than
  adjusting width and height. This should result in a better looking result,
  particularly with more complex pages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.23
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improved handling of deleted pages for ScrollRect-based PagedRects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.22
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added pagination to the "Page Previews" template prefabs - it isn't enabled
  or visible by default, but you can now implement pagination via the
  "Show Pagination" options.
- All ScrollRect-based PagedRects can now use an optional scrollbar (via
  ScrollRect -> Show Scroll Bar)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.21
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Some improvements and minor bug fixes to "Loop Seamlessly" functionality
- A lot of refactoring, PagedRect.cs is now split across multiple partial
  classes for easier readability. More refactoring to come in time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.20
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a new "Loop Seamlessly" option which allows the PagedRect to scroll
  endlessly through pages by moving the pages around as you scroll (instead of
  scrolling all the way back to the first page when you reach the end / last page
  when you reach the beginning). This is a new feature which, despite having
  been tested extensively, may have some unexpected issues - please let
  me know if you run into any problems!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a new prefab / menu item for PagedRects with nested ScrollRects
- Added a new example showcasing PagedRects with nested ScrollRects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.18
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Replaced the default 'ScrollRect' used by all of the ScrollRect PagedRect
  prefabs with a new 'PagedRect_ScrollRect' which provides additional options
  (such as the ability to optionally disable dragging / mousewheel scrolling)
- Added a new 'Page Previews' mode to ScrollRect implementations; in this mode
  PagedRect will render both the current page as well as the next and previous
  ones (these pages will be rendered at a smaller size, and act as next/previous
  buttons). This functionality is controlled by the new 'ShowPagePreviews'
  property, along with 'PagePreviewScale' and the preexisting 'SpaceBetweenPages'
  property. Please note that the pages are NOT scaled using transform.localScale,
  instead their width and height are adjusted - so this feature will only work
  for page content which scales to fit its container (e.g. scaled images).
- Added new examples showcasing the new Page Preview functionality
- Added new prefabs and menu items for Page Previews ('Page Previews - Horizontal'
  and 'Page Previews - Vertical')
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.17
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where sometimes pages in a ScrollRect implementation wouldn't
  be sized correctly initially
- Added the 'SpaceBetweenPages' property

v1.16
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Minor bug fix
- A few minor internal adjustments to improve compatibility with XmlLayout (sold separately)

v1.15
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added an example with a nested ScrollRect
- Fixed a bug with page positioning in a Vertical PagedRect with ScrollRect

v1.14
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Page animations can now optionally be overriden on a page-by-page basis (check the Page component for details)

v1.13
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug Fixes
	- Fixed an issue introduced in v1.1 which caused the wrong page enter/exit animation to be played
	- Rewrote the scrollrect positioning code, it should be more reliable now
	- Fixed a bug where sometimes the scrollrect would sometimes stay in the position to which it was dragged instead of moving to the closest page

v1.12
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug Fixes
	- Fixed an issue where pages would not be resized correctly when the PagedRect or its Viewport is resized
	- Fixed an issue where the scrollrect would not be positioned correctly when the PagedRect or its Viewport is resized

v1.11
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug Fixes
	- Fixed an issue where an exception would be triggered when attempting to remove the last page with RemovePage()
	- Fixed an issue where Page components were destroyed by RemovePage() instead of the Page GameObjects when destroyPageObject is set to true

v1.1 Major Update
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added Support for a new Continuous Scrolling mode (using a ScrollRect)
	- Added new Prefabs which utilize the new mode (existing PagedRect instances can be updated to use this mode, but it involves some manual changes)
	- Existing PagedRect instances will not be affected - they will continue to function as they did before
- Examples:
	- Added a new Slider - ScrollRect example which utilizes Continous Scrolling
- Bug Fixes:
	- Fixed an issue where the Editor would sometimes show the wrong page as being selected in the inspector

V1.01
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added Support for Scroll Wheel Input
- Added option to highlight the PagedRect on MouseOver
- 'Loop Endlessly' now works regardless of how you reach the next/previous page
- Added a 'PageChanged' event to the PagedRect - triggered every time the page is changes (Arguments: New Page, Previous Page)
- Examples:
	- Added Scroll Wheel Input control to the Vertical Pagination Example
	- Added Enable/Disable button control to the Dynamic Pages Example
	- Added a new Fantasy-style "Character Creation" example
- Bug Fixes:
	- Fixed an issue with nested PagedRects
	- Fixed a bug with the Fade animation type when rapidly changing pages
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V1.00
